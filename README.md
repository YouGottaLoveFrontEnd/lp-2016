---

The first international conference of its kind to be held in Israel, will take place in Tel Aviv
from June 8th through June 9th, 2015. To kick off the inaugural edition of this annual conference,
the world’s top leaders in the field of front-end development will be among the featured
guest speakers.

The two-day conference will bring together the best of the best in front-end development from
across the globe as well as from across Israel.  For the first time, all of Israel’s front-end
developers, who are among the brightest, most tech-savvy this Start-Up Nation has to offer, will
all be in the same place at the same time.  This conference – and its future editions – is a great
way for the international community and its leaders to get to know Israel’s rising front-end
development community and vice versa.

You Gotta Love Frontend will also provide a fun, energized atmosphere in which the field’s freshest minds can share
their experiences, creative ideas and latest technologies – over pints of beer. With conference
participation expected to reach 700 attendees, like-minded developers will find an enriching
opportunity to interact with each other, learn from one another and establish a professional
network of communication.

Created by Israel’s top front-end developers specifically for front-end developers, You Gotta Love Frontend, and its
jam-packed schedule of high-quality content, promises to be the industry’s most worthwhile
and value-adding conference to attend (and did we mention there’ll be beer?)
